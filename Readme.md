## Normal Mode

* Using the images below as a template/guide - build a simple contact list
* On your "home" view, show a list of all of the users in your database.
* When I click on any of the users, I'm routed to a view with that user's info.
* There should be a `back` button or icon to take me back to the home (list) view.
* The URL should also change to reflect the current resource I'm viewing.
* There needs to be a third "add" view, where you see a contact form and can add a new contact
* After you add a new contact, I should be routed back to the home "list" page
* You must use ControllerAs syntax for all of your controllers
* You must utalize a Service to help handle all of your `$http` requests
* All of your data should be stored on the class server
